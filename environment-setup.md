# Your Battle Station

If you spend any more than about five minutes doing cybersecurity, you will likely want to develop your own dedicated computing environment to perform tasks in this space.
While we do browse the internet and process text documents, we also perform many other specialized tasks. A general-purpose computing environment is suboptimal.
To this end, platforms such as TryHackMe and HackTheBox do offer cloud-based, on-demand virtual machines for your use. They have them prepared with many tools and resources; however, you are, more or less, locked in to their dedicated instance if you choose to rely on this offering.

You may want to consider setting up your own local virtual machine, dedicated computer, or cloud instance for the sole purpose of doing CTFs and security research and such. There are many paths here, but Kali Linux and Parrot are two common choices. These Operating Systems come with many tools already installed to make your life easier. THM and HTB will provide you VPN connectivity which will allow you network access to their challenges while using your own attack infrastrcture. Any customization you make can now advantage you no matter which CTF or training platform you use, so long as they provide you VPN access.
