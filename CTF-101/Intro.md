# What are CTFs? 

Capture the Flag events are a gamified way of putting your technical skills to the test by solving puzzles with the result of discovering the "flag" which serves as proof of completion of the given task. A common convention is for flags to adhere to a format similar to "ctf{UNIQUE_FLAG_VALUE}", but the flag may also be the answer to a question.

CTFs can take a few forms. 
Some are jeopardy-style, knowledge-based and others are more open-world, hands-on movement through a series of steps. 
Common topics covered are cryptography, forensics, web applications/pwn, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), binary reverse engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Large Language Models (LLMs), Red Teaming, IoT, etc. 
They will often consist of challenges ranging from easy/beginner-friendly tasks to advanced/more involved adventures. There should be something for everybody. 
Many CTFs will allow teams to compete, so folks can share their abilities and tackle more than a single individual could.

# Mindset / Approach

We all start somewhere. It is up to you to find the next best step to solve the challenge. No one person has all the answers, so it is 100% fair game to use any and all available resources and creativity toward solving the challenge (within the scope / Rules of Engagement / rules for the CTF).
Use AI. Use your favorite search engine. Use your previous experience. Use your team. 

After spending some time working on a challenge without solving it, consider stepping away from your computer to get some fresh air and free your brain. You'll be shocked at how many times clearing your mind will help things click back into place.
