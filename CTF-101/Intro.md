# What are CTFs? 

Capture the Flag events are a gamified way of putting your technical skills to the test by solving puzzles with the result of discovering the "flag" which serves as proof of completion of the given task. A common convention is for flags to adhere to a format similar to "ctf{UNIQUE_FLAG_VALUE}", but the flag may also be the answer to a question.

CTFs can take a few forms. Some are jeopardy-style, knowledge-based and others are more open-world, hands-on movement through a series of steps. Common topics covered are cryptography, forensics, web applications, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Large Language Models (LLMs), Red Teaming, etc. They will often consist of challenges ranging from easy/beginner-friendly tasks to advanced/more invovled adventures. There should be something for everybody. Many CTFs will allow teams to compete, so folks can share their abilities and tackle more than a single individual could.
