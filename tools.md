There are hundreds or thousands of potential tools out there for every use case under the sun. Even within a specific category, there may be several tools that do the same job. You should explore various options and develop your own scripts and automations to combine these most effectively.
This is NOT an exhaustive list by any means. It does provide a good base of the most commonly used tools.
